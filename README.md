# Readable

This is a small post/comments system made for Udacity's Redux course. Any user may select categories, add/remove/update posts or comments, and give likes as well.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server coded by Udacity, and a frontend Server by me.

## Start

To get started right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, start the frontend server
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
Information about the Frontend server code can be found in its [README file](frontend/README.md).
